## From the normal to the standard normal distribution

A generic [normal distribution](https://algebrica.org/normal-distribution) $\mathcal{N} \left(\right. x ; \mu , \sigma \left.\right)$ can always be transformed into its standardized form $N \left(\right. x ; 0 , 1 \left.\right)$ by introducing the standard variable $Z$, defined as

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

This transformation, known as standardization, expresses each value of the [continuous random variable](https://algebrica.org/continuous-random-variables/) $X$ in terms of the number of [standard deviations](https://algebrica.org/variance-and-covariance-of-a-random-variable/) it lies away from the [mean](https://algebrica.org/mean-or-expected-value-of-a-random-variable/) $\mu$. As a result, the new variable $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$.

---

The process of standardization is particularly useful because it places different normal distributions on a common scale. Once the variable $X$ has been transformed into the standard variable $Z$, probabilities and critical values can be derived directly from the standard normal distribution $N \left(\right. x ; 0 , 1 \left.\right)$.

This allows statistical problems to be solved using a single universal reference table (Z table), simplifying calculations and comparisons across different contexts.

## Standard Z Table

**The standard Z table** lists, for each cell, the cumulative probability to the left of a given $Z$ value. In other words, it shows the probability that a standard normal variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specified Z-score. These values correspond to the area under the standard normal curve from negative infinity up to the chosen point on the horizontal axis, represented by the value of $z$.

The complete Z table is extensive, as it contains values for a wide range of Z-scores. For brevity, only a portion of the table is shown below as an illustrative extract.

##### Several online resources, both static and [interactive](https://ztable.io), allow users to compute cumulative probabilities for different values of $z$.

Using the Z table is straightforward.

- The row corresponding to the $Z$ value contains the [integer](https://algebrica.org/integers/) part and the first decimal place
- The column represents the remaining decimal places starting from the second one.
- The cell at the intersection of the selected row and column gives the cumulative probability up to the specified value of $z$.

## Example 1

Let us consider a simple example to illustrate how the Z table is used to determine the cumulative probability corresponding to a given value of the standardized variable $Z$. Let us consider the case of a standardized variable $Z$ such that:

$$z = 0.16$$

To find the cumulative probability to the left of the standardized variable $z$, we locate the value 0.1 in the row and 0.06 in the column of the Z table. The intersection of these two entries gives the corresponding probability value, which in this case is $0.5636$.

| z | .00 | .01 | .02 | .03 | .04 | .05 | **.06** | .07 | .08 | … |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.0 | .5000 | .5040 | .5080 | .5120 | .5160 | .5199 | .5239 | .5279 | .5319 | … |
| **0.1** | .5398 | .5438 | .5478 | .5517 | .5557 | .5596 | **.5636** | .5675 | .5714 | … |
| … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … |

---

This means that approximately 56.36% of the observations in a standard normal distribution fall below this value of $z$. We can therefore state that the probability of the standardized variable $Z$ being less than $z = 0.16$ is equal to $0.5636$, that is:

$$P \left(\right. Z < 0.16 \left.\right) = 0.5636$$

![](https://algebrica.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/images/normal-distribution-standard-2-1.png)

Since the total area under the standard normal curve equals $1$, and the distribution is symmetric with respect to its [mean](https://algebrica.org/mean-or-expected-value-of-a-random-variable/), we can immediately deduce that

$$P \left(\right. Z > 0.16 \left.\right) = 1 - 0.5636$$

Moreover, the probability that $Z$ lies between $0$ and $0.16$ is obtained by subtracting the cumulative probability up to $Z = 0$ from that up to $Z = 0.16$:

$$P \left(\right. 0 < Z < 0.16 \left.\right) = P \left(\right. Z < 0.16 \left.\right) - P \left(\right. Z < 0 \left.\right)$$

Substituting the corresponding values gives

$$P \left(\right. 0 < Z < 0.16 \left.\right) = 0.5636 - 0.5 = 0.0636$$

Finally, due to the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean, the probability that $Z$ lies within the [interval](https://algebrica.org/intervals/) $- 0.16 < Z < 0.16$ is twice the probability of being between $0$ and $0.16$:

$$P \left(\right. - 0.16 < Z < 0.16 \left.\right) = 2 \times P \left(\right. 0 < Z < 0.16 \left.\right) = 0.1272$$

## Example 2

Suppose that the average lifetime of a rechargeable battery is $\mu = 8.0$ hours, with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 1.2$ hours, and that battery life follows a normal distribution. We want to calculate the probability that a randomly selected battery lasts less than $6.5$ hours.

---

To find the probability $P \left(\right. X < 6.5 \left.\right)$, we need to determine the area under the normal curve to the left of $6.5$. For this purpose, we apply the standardization formula:

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

where $x$ represents the observed value of the random variable, which in this case corresponds to 6.5 hours. We have:

$$z = \frac{6.5 - 8.0}{1.2} = \frac{- 1.5}{1.2} = - 1.25$$

We can then use the Z table to find $P \left(\right. Z < - 1.25 \left.\right)$, which gives the cumulative probability associated with this value of $z$.

| z | .00 | .01 | .02 | .03 | .04 | **.05** | .06 | .07 | .08 | … |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -1.0 | .1587 | .1562 | .1539 | .1515 | .1492 | .1469 | .1446 | .1423 | .1401 | … |
| **-1.2** | .1151 | .1131 | .1112 | .1093 | .1075 | **.1056** | .1038 | .1020 | .1003 | … |
| -1.3 | .0968 | .0951 | .0934 | .0918 | .0901 | .0885 | .0869 | .0853 | .0838 | … |
| … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … | … |

From the intersection of the selected row and column, we obtain a probability value equal to $0.1056$. The figure below illustrates where this probability is located under the standard normal curve, corresponding to the cumulative area to the left of $z = - 1.25$.

![](https://algebrica.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/images/normal-distribution-standard-4.png)

From the standard normal table, we obtain

$$P \left(\right. Z < - 1.25 \left.\right) = 0.1056$$

##### This means that approximately 10.56% of all batteries are expected to last less than 6.5 hours.
