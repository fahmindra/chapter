## What are homogeneous trigonometric equations

Homogeneous trigonometric equations are [equations](https://algebrica.org/equations) in which all terms involve trigonometric functions, such as [sine and cosine](https://algebrica.org/sine-and-cosine), [raised](https://algebrica.org/powers) to the same degree. A first-degree homogeneous trigonometric equation is generally represented by the form:

$$a sin ⁡ x + b cos ⁡ x = 0$$

Each term in the equation is of degree $1$ and $a$ and $b$ are [real coefficients](https://algebrica.org/types-of-numbers). A general form of a first-degree trigonometric equation is:

$$a sin ⁡ x + b cos ⁡ x + c = 0$$

This equation is considered homogeneous when the constant term $c = 0$. Similar considerations apply to second-degree homogeneous trigonometric equations, which include only terms of second degree. These equations are generally written in the form:

$$a sin^{2} ⁡ x + b sin ⁡ x cos ⁡ x + c cos^{2} ⁡ x = 0$$

##### The definition can be generalized to equations of the third, fourth, fifth degree, and so on. In these cases, all terms must involve trigonometric [functions](https://algebrica.org/functions) raised to the same degree, ensuring the equation remains homogeneous.

Homogeneous equations of degree $n$ can be solved by dividing each term of the equation by $cos^{n} ⁡ x$, thereby transforming the equation into one expressed in terms of $tan ⁡ x$.

## Example 1

Let’s solve the first-degree homogeneous trigonometric equation:
$$sin ⁡ x - \sqrt{3} cos ⁡ x = 0$$

---

Dividing the equation by $cos ⁡ x$, we obtain:

$$\frac{sin ⁡ x}{cos ⁡ x} - \sqrt{3} = 0$$

Since the ratio of sine to cosine equals the [tangent](https://algebrica.org/tangent-and-cotangent), we can rewrite the equation in terms of $tan ⁡ x .$

$$tan ⁡ x = \sqrt{3}$$

Solving the equation we get the value:

$$x = arctan ⁡ \left(\right. \sqrt{3} \left.\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}$$

Since the tangent function is periodic with period $\pi$, the general solution is:

$$x = \frac{\pi}{3} + k \pi , k \in \mathbb{Z}$$

Whenever [trigonometric identities](https://algebrica.org/trigonometric-identities/) allow us to rewrite a trigonometric equation in homogeneous form, it is generally preferable to do so, as it can simplify the calculations and make the solution process more manageable.

## Example 2

Let us now consider the second-degree trigonometric equation:

$$sin^{2} ⁡ x + sin ⁡ 2 x - cos^{2} ⁡ x = 0$$

At first glance, this is not a homogeneous equation, because not all terms are of the same degree. In particular, $sin ⁡ 2 x$ is a first-degree term, while $sin^{2} ⁡ x$ and $cos^{2} ⁡ x$ involve second-degree expressions. In an equation like this, we cannot proceed by dividing all terms by $cos^{2} ⁡ x$, because the first-degree term does not transform into a useful expression for solving the equation. In fact, this method works only when all terms are of the same degree, as in homogeneous equations.

However, using [trigonometric identities](https://algebrica.org/trigonometric-identities/), specifically the double angle formula, we can rewrite $sin ⁡ \left(\right. 2 x \left.\right)$ as $2 sin ⁡ \left(\right. x \left.\right) cos ⁡ \left(\right. x \left.\right)$. The equation then becomes:

$$sin^{2} ⁡ x + 2 sin ⁡ x cos ⁡ x - cos^{2} ⁡ x = 0$$

In this way, we have transformed the original equation into a second-degree homogeneous trigonometric equation, which can now be solved by dividing all terms by $cos^{2} ⁡ x$. The equation becomes:

$$\frac{sin^{2} ⁡ x}{cos^{2} ⁡ x} + \frac{2 sin ⁡ x cos ⁡ x}{cos^{2} ⁡ x} - \frac{cos^{2} ⁡ x}{cos^{2} ⁡ x} = 0$$

---

Simplifying each term, we obtain:

$$tan^{2} ⁡ x + 2 tan ⁡ x - 1 = 0$$

This is a [quadratic equation](https://algebrica.org/quadratic-equations) in $tan ⁡ x$, and can now be solved using the [quadratic formula](https://algebrica.org/quadratic-formula). Let’s substitute $t = tan ⁡ x$. The equation becomes:

$$t^{2} + 2 t - 1 = 0$$

Using the quadratic formula, we have:

$$t = \frac{- 2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{- 2 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}}{2} = - 1 \pm \sqrt{2}$$

The two solutions are:

$$t_{1} = - 1 + \sqrt{2} , t_{2} = - 1 - \sqrt{2}$$

---

Substituting back $t = tan ⁡ x$, we obtain the solutions:

$$tan ⁡ x = - 1 + \sqrt{2} \text{and} tan ⁡ x = - 1 - \sqrt{2}$$

The general solutions are:

$$x_{1} = arctan ⁡ \left(\right. - 1 + \sqrt{2} \left.\right) + k \pi k \in \mathbb{Z}$$
$$x_{2} = arctan ⁡ \left(\right. - 1 - \sqrt{2} \left.\right) + k \pi k \in \mathbb{Z}$$
