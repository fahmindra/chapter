## Inductive set

Mathematical induction is a fundamental principle used to rigorously prove statements concerning [natural numbers](https://algebrica.org/natural-numbers). A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is said to be inductive if it satisfies the following two conditions:

- $0 \in A$.
- $\forall x \in A$ it follows that $x + 1 \in A$.

In other words, an inductive set contains the element $0$ and is closed under the operation of adding $1$.

---

Let $A , B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be two inductive sets. Then, their intersection $A \cap B$ is also an inductive set. Since $A$ and $B$ are inductive, we have:

- $0 \in A$ and $0 \in B$, thus $0 \in A \cap B$.
- If $x \in A \cap B$, then $x \in A$ and $x \in B$. By the inductive property, $x + 1 \in A$ and $x + 1 \in B$, hence $x + 1 \in A \cap B$.

Therefore, $A \cap B$ satisfies the conditions to be an inductive set. In particular, the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is itself an inductive set, and more precisely, it is the smallest inductive set, being the intersection of all inductive subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

## Mathematical induction

Starting from the formal definition of an inductive set, let us consider a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ defined by a property $p \left(\right. n \left.\right)$, such that $A = \left{\right. n \in \mathbb{N} \mid p \left(\right. n \left.\right) \left.\right}$. Suppose the following conditions hold:

- $p \left(\right. 0 \left.\right)$ is true, that is, $0 \in A .$
- $p \left(\right. n \left.\right) \rightarrow p \left(\right. n + 1 \left.\right) \forall n \in \mathbb{N} ,$ that is, if $n \in A$, then $n + 1 \in A .$

Thus, $p \left(\right. n \left.\right)$ is true for every $n \in \mathbb{N} .$

---

These two conditions correspond precisely to the structure of a proof by mathematical induction:

- The base case consists of verifying that $p \left(\right. 0 \left.\right)$ holds, meaning that $0$ belongs to $A$.
- The inductive step consists of proving that, whenever $p \left(\right. n \left.\right)$ is true for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, it follows that $p \left(\right. n + 1 \left.\right)$ is also true, thereby ensuring that $n + 1 \in A$.

## Example 1

Let us see a practical application of the principle of mathematical induction by proving the following statement (the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers):

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i = \frac{n \left(\right. n + 1 \left.\right)}{2} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$$

We first consider the base case. For $n = 0$, the left-hand side is an empty sum, which equals $0$ by convention. The right-hand side gives:

$$\frac{0 \left(\right. 0 + 1 \left.\right)}{2} = 0$$

Thus, the formula holds when $n = 0$.

---

We now move to the inductive step. We assume that the formula is true for some arbitrary $k \in \mathbb{N}$; that is, we suppose:

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{k} i = \frac{k \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)}{2} .$$

Under this assumption, we must prove that the formula also holds for $k + 1$. Starting from the left-hand side:

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{k + 1} i = \frac{k \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)}{2} + \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right) .$$

Simplifying, we obtain:

$$\frac{k \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right) + 2 \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)}{2} = \frac{\left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right) \left(\right. k + 2 \left.\right)}{2} .$$

This is exactly the right-hand side of the formula with $n = k + 1$. Since the statement holds for $n = 0$ and its validity for $n = k$ implies its validity for $n = k + 1$, by the principle of mathematical induction, the formula is true for every natural number $n$.

It follows that the formula holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Applications: divisibility

We show that the expression $n^{3} - n$ is divisible by $3$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We start with the base case. For $n = 0$, we have $0^{3} - 0 = 0$, and $3 \mid 0$ holds trivially since $0 = 3 \cdot 0.$

We now turn to the inductive step. Assume that $3 \mid k^{3} - k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, that is, $k^{3} - k = 3 m$ for some integer $m$. Under this hypothesis, we want to show that divisibility by $3$ carries over to the next term, meaning that $3 \mid \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)^{3} - \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)$. Expanding the expression we obtain:

$$\left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)^{3} - \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right) & = k^{3} + 3 k^{2} + 3 k + 1 - k - 1 \\ & = \left(\right. k^{3} - k \left.\right) + 3 k^{2} + 3 k$$

By the inductive hypothesis, $k^{3} - k = 3 m$, so the expression becomes:

$$\left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)^{3} - \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right) & = 3 m + 3 k^{2} + 3 k \\ & = 3 \left(\right. m + k^{2} + k \left.\right)$$

Since $m + k^{2} + k \in \mathbb{Z}$, it follows that $3 \mid \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)^{3} - \left(\right. k + 1 \left.\right)$. By the principle of induction, the statement holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Applications: inequality

We show that $2^{n} > n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This inequality expresses the fact that exponential growth eventually and permanently dominates linear growth, a pattern that induction captures precisely: once the inequality holds at a given step, the multiplicative nature of the left-hand side guarantees it continues to hold at the next.

We start with the base case. For $n = 0$, we have $2^{0} = 1 > 0$, so the inequality holds.

The inductive step proceeds as follows. Assume that $2^{k} > k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The goal is to demonstrate that $2^{k + 1} > k + 1$. Consider the left-hand side:

$$2^{k + 1} & = 2 \cdot 2^{k} \\ & > 2 k \\ & = k + k$$

Since $k \geq 0$, we have $k + k \geq k + 1$ for every $k \geq 1$, and the case $k = 0$ is already covered by the base case. Therefore $2^{k + 1} > k + 1$, and by the principle of induction, the inequality holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Applications: geometric series

We show that for any real number $r \neq 1$ and every $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

$$\sum_{i = 0}^{n} r^{i} = \frac{r^{n + 1} - 1}{r - 1}$$

This identity is the closed form of the partial sum of a [geometric sequence](https://algebrica.org/geometric-sequence/), and induction provides a clean route to its verification. We start with the base case. For $n = 0$, the left-hand side gives $r^{0} = 1$, and the right-hand side gives:

$$\frac{r^{1} - 1}{r - 1} = 1$$

The formula holds for $n = 0$.

---

The inductive step proceeds as follows. Assume the formula holds for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, that is:

$$\sum_{i = 0}^{k} r^{i} = \frac{r^{k + 1} - 1}{r - 1}$$

We want to show it holds for $k + 1$. Starting from the left-hand side:

$$\sum_{i = 0}^{k + 1} r^{i} & = \sum_{i = 0}^{k} r^{i} + r^{k + 1} \\ & = \frac{r^{k + 1} - 1}{r - 1} + r^{k + 1}$$

Combining the two terms over a common denominator:

$$\frac{r^{k + 1} - 1}{r - 1} + r^{k + 1} & = \frac{r^{k + 1} - 1 + r^{k + 1} \left(\right. r - 1 \left.\right)}{r - 1} \\ & = \frac{r^{k + 2} - 1}{r - 1}$$

This is exactly the right-hand side of the formula with $n = k + 1$. By the principle of induction, the identity holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
